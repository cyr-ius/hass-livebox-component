### Initial setup

You must have set a password for your Livebox router web administration page.

The first time Home Assistant will connect to your Livebox, you will need to specify the password of livebox.

### Supported routers

Only the routers with Livebox OS are supported:

- Livebox v3
- Livebox v4
- Livebox v5
- Livebox v6
- Livebox v7 (not tested)
- KPN Box 12 (Firmware: V12.C.23.04.36)

### Unsupported routers

Despite being labelled "Livebox", the following router models **cannot** be supported:

## Presence Detection

This platform offers presence detection by keeping track of the
devices connected to a [Livebox](http://www.orange.fr/) router.

Ability to disable this option by integration options

### Notes

Note that the Livebox waits for some time before marking a device as inactive, meaning that there will be a small delay (1 or 2 minutes) between the time you disconnect a device and the time it will appear as "away" in Home Assistant.

You should take this into account when specifying the `consider_home` parameter.
On the contrary, the Livebox immediately reports devices newly connected, so they should appear as "home" almost instantly, as soon as Home Assistant refreshes the devices states.

## Sensor

This platform offers you sensors to monitor a Livebox router. The monitored conditions are instant upload and download rates in Mb/s.
